# Dependency Hooks

If you want to insert some behavior at certain times (e.g., immediately configuring it after a dependency is instantiated), you can use the following dependency hooks.

## `onInstantiation`

For `ClassDependencyItem` and `FactoryDependencyItem`, if you want to do something immediately after the dependency is instantiated, you can pass an `onInstantiation` hook.

```ts highlight=6
const configService = [
  IConfigService,
  {
    useClass: ConfigService,
    lazy: true,
    onInstantiation: (s: IConfigService) => {
      s.setConfig();
    },
  },
];
```

This function will be called immediately after the constructor or factory is executed. If a `ClassDependencyItem` is lazily instantiated, it will be called immediately after lazy instantiation.
