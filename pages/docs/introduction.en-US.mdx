# Getting started

<Callout>
  It is highly recommended to learn a thing or two about dependency injection

## Installation

Inside your project, run the following:

```shell
yarn add @wendellhu/redi
```

or use other package managers such as npm:

```shell
npm install @wendellhu/redi
```

After installation, you should enable `experimentalDecorators` in the tsconfig.json file:

```json highlight=3
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

## Basic usage

Let's get started with an example:

```tsx
class AuthService {
  public static getCurrentUserInfo(): UserInfo {
    // your implementation here...
  }
}

class FileListService {
  constructor() {}

  public getUserFiles(): Promise<Files> {
    const currentUser = AuthService.getCurrentUserInfo();
    // ...
  }
}
```

Obviously `FileListService` depends on `AuthService`. Let's see how we can make this piece of code dependency injection flavour.

**Step One. Declare dependency relationship.**

```typescript highlight=1,4,10,13
import { Inject } from "@wendellhu/redi";

class AuthService {
  public getCurrentUserInfo(): UserInfo {
    // your implementation here...
  }
}

class FileListService {
  constructor(@Inject(AuthService) private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  public getUserFiles(): Promise<Files> {
    const currentUser = this.authService.getCurrentUserInfo();
    // ...
  }
}
```

Use the decorator `Inject` to declare on the constructor of `FileListService` that `AuthService` is one of its dependencies.

**Step Two: Provide dependencies.**

```typescript
import { Injector } from "@wendellhu/redi";

const injector = new Injector([[FileListService], [AuthService]]);
```

All your have to do is pass them into the constructor of `Injector`.

**Step Three. Wire up.**

```typescript
const fileListService = injector.get(FileListService);
```

Then you get an instance of `FileListService`, and its dependency `AuthService` is also constructed and cached in the `Injector.

```typescript
const authService = injector.get(FileListService);
```
