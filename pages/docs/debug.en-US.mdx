## Import scripts of redi more than once

<Callout>
[redi]: You are loading scripts of redi more than once! This may cause undesired behavior in your application.
Maybe your dependencies added redi as its dependency and bundled redi to its dist files. Or you import different versions of redi.
</Callout>

This error happens when you import scripts of redi more than once. This usually happens when

1. Some dependencies in your workspace use `@wendellhu/redi` as well. However, they don't use redi as a peer dependency and avoid bundling redi.
2. You are working on a monorepo and packages uses different versions of redi.

redi use `Symbol` and `instanceof` internally. So things may not work when you import redi more than once. To fix this problem:

1. Contact the maintainer of these dependencies and ask them set `@wendellhu/redi` as an external dependency and add it into `peerDependencies` instead of `dependencies`.
2. Use the same version of redi across your monorepo.

## Could not find dependency registered on

<Callout>
[redi]: It seems that you register "undefined" as dependency on the X parameter of "XXX". Please make sure that there is not cyclic dependency among your TypeScript files, or consider using "forwardRef".
</Callout>

This errors happens when redi is trying to figure out what dependencies `XXX` relies on but a dependency is resolved to `undefined`.

Let's assume that the dependency resolved to `undefined` is `YYY`.

1. `YYY` must be a class type dependency.
2. Due to how TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript. `YYY` is declared first and later assigned to the constructor function of `YYY`.
3. There is cycle dependency among your TypeScript files that leads to `YYY` being evaluated as `undefined` when `Inject` decorator is trying to register `YYY` as a dependency on `XXX`.

To fix this problem, you can use `forwardRef`

```ts
import { Inject, forwardRef } from '@wendellhu/redi'

class XXX {
    constructor(@Inject(forwardRef(() => YYY)) private readonly _yyy: YYY) {}
}

```

... or fix cycle dependency in your codebase. We recommend using [dpdm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dpdm) to find cycle dependency in your codebase. You could traverse the dependency tree staring from the file that contains `XXX`, and break cycles those contains the file.
