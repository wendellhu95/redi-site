# Creating a new instance for every injection

You can use `WithNew` to inject a new instance every time, which only makes sense when the dependency is a class or a factory.

When the injection item is a class:

```ts
let c = 0

class A {
    count = c++
}

class B {
    constructor(@WithNew() @Inject(A) private readonly a: A) {}

    get(): number {
        return this.a.count
    }
}

const j = new Injector([[A], [B]])
const b1 = j.createInstance(B)
const b2 = j.createInstance(B)

expect(b1.get()).toBe(0)
expect(b2.get()).toBe(1)
})
```

When the injection item is a factory:

```ts
let c = 0;

const ICount = createIdentifier<number>("ICount");

class B {
  constructor(@WithNew() @Inject(ICount) public readonly count: number) {}
}

const j = new Injector([[B], [ICount, { useFactory: () => c++ }]]);

const b1 = j.createInstance(B);
const b2 = j.createInstance(B);

expect(b1.count).toBe(0);
expect(b2.count).toBe(1);
```

Note that redi would not cache the instance so you need to dispose the instance by yourself.
