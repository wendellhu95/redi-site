# Hierarchical injectors

## Creating hierarchical injectors

There are two ways to create parenting relationship between two injectors. The first approach is to call`createChild` method on the parent injector:

```ts highlight=2
const parentInjector = new Injector([[PlatformService]]);
const childInjector = parentInjector.createChild([[OrderService]]);
```

The second is to pass the parent injector as the second parameter when constructing an new injector:

```ts highlight=2
const parentInjector = new Injector([[PlatformService]]);
const childInjector = new Injector([[OrderService]], parentInjector);
```

## Single way lookup

When the child injector could not resolve an identifier, it would delegate the request to its parent if possible. And that is called dependency lookup. In the example below, `PlatformService` is actually constructed by `parentInjector`.

```ts highlight=2
childInjector.get(PlatformService);
```

## Interfere lookup

You could tell redi how to perform the lookup process using specific decorators. You could use `SkipSelf` to skip the current injector, or `Self` to disable lookup:

```ts highlight=3,4
class ChartComponent {
  constructor(
    @Self() @Inject(Container) private readonly selfContainer: Container,
    @SkipSelf()
    @Optional(Container)
    private readonly parentContainer?: Container,
  ) {}
}
```
