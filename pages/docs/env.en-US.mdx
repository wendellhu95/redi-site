# Setting up the development environment

Since redi's API uses TypeScript decorator syntax, you need to enable `experimentalDecorators` in your tsconfig.json.

```json highlight=3
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
  }
}
```

Note: Make sure that TypeScript is translating your source code, not Babel, as Babel's support for decorators is different from TypeScript.

## Scaffold Tool

Configuring your own development tools can be quite cumbersome. To get started quickly and enjoy the benefits of dependency injection, we have prepared a scaffold tool called [redi-starter](https://github.com/wzhudev/redi-starter).

It provides the following features:

- Integration of redi with proper TypeScript configuration
- Integration with Prettier / ESLint / webpack / Jest
- Support for loading different code based on the target platform, for example, not loading `PcPlatformService` code on mobile devices

### Usage

Simply clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wzhudev/redi-starter.git
```

If you don't want to keep the Git history, you can use the [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) tool:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/wzhudev/redi-starter
```
