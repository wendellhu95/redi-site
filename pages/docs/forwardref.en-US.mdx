# forwardRef

In the following example, `Person` is defined before `Father` but relies on `Father`. In this case, you should use `forwardRef` to wrap `Father`. Otherwise redi would receive `undefined` when tries to figure out dependencies of `Person` (and it would throw an error in that case).

```ts highlight=5,7
import { Self, SkipSelf } from '@wendellhu/redi'

class Person {
  constructor(
    @Self() @Inject(forwardRef(() => Father)) private readonly father: Father,
    @SkipSelf()
    @Inject(forwardRef(() => Father))
    private readonly grandfather: Father
  ) {}
}

class Man extends Person {}
class Father extends Man {
  changeDiaper(): void {}
}
```
