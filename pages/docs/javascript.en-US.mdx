# Using in JavaScript (ES5+)

Even if you are not using TypeScript, you can still use redi.

redi's syntax dependency in TypeScript is limited to decorators, which are only used to declare dependencies on classes. JavaScript does not have decorators, so instead you can use `setDependencies`:

In TypeScript, you would have code like this:

```ts
class MapService {
  constructor(
    @SkipSelf()
    @ISatelliteService
    private readonly satellite: ISatelliteService,
  ) {}
}
```

The equivalent code in JavaScript would be:

```js
class MapService {
  constructor(satellite) {
    this.satellite = satellite;
  }
}

setDependencies(MapService, [[new SkipSelf(), ISatelliteService]]);
```

As you can see, the syntax for declaring dependencies is consistent with declaring dependencies on factory functions.
