# Identifier

There are two ways to create an identifier.

## Class as identifier

A class could be the identifier of iteself:

```typescript
class ClassDependency {}

const injector = new Injector([[ClassDependency]])
```

So you can get the dependency from the injector directly:

```ts
const classDependency = injector.get(ClassDependency)
```

However, this approach leave abstraction aside and hence is less flexible.

## `IdentifierDecorator`

It is recommend to create an `IdentifierDecorator` via `createIdentifier`:

```ts
interface IPlatformService {}

const IPlatformService = createIdentifier<IPlatformService>('platform')

class PlatformServiceImpl implements IPlatformService {}

const injector = new Injector([[IPlatformService, { useClass: PlatformServiceImpl }]])

const platformIns = injector.get(IPlatformService)
```

This approach is considered better because:

* It complies with [the principle of dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle).
* `IdentifierDecorator`, as its name suggests, could be used as a decorator to declare dependency among items.


<Callout>In TypeScript, types and values take different namespace. So it is legal for an interface and a value to share the name `IPlatformService`.</Callout>
